/*
Day by day gaining the passion for 
both front and back-end. Have no personal preference to a programming language or application, as that means my
ideology and issue solving skills are being married to techonology rather than an adaptive solution. My dream job
is that which it is possible to interact and collaborate with an multi-cultural team. The desire and need to learn
is shared between all colleagues. My ideal company aspire to create the best solution for its clients, rather
than just reach a number

					Currently crafting a senior software engineer for web, desktop, and mobile solutions. Dreaming of the day
					were all my findings, winnings, and misses will become a point of reference for starting colleagues. Helping
					others with knowledge and man power is what sets a smile on my face. My goal is to be part of a team and a company
					where the will of continuos learning, helping their community, and aiming to always deliver the best product 
					(rather than complete a number on a file) is their passion.
